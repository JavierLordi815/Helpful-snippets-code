# Useful commands I found using `convert` tool

This tool helps me converting images between formats. Below is a list of useful commands I found using this tool:

- **Converting to EPS format**: info extracted from this [StackOverFlow post]() 
  - Level 2: it provides the best compatibility, and works well with jpeg images.
  - Level 3: it will produce the smallest files. Use it if you can.
  command:
  ```bash
  convert fig.png eps3:fig.eps
  ```
